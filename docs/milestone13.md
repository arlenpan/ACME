We worked on the create new list functionality. We also modified the path so that it no longer starts at your current location because we felt like if users were using this to create a trip, they might not be starting from their current location. Therefore, we decided to start from the first location of the list. Also, we changed the infoWindow content so instead of just showing the address, it now displays both the name of the location and the actual address, so that users don't have to remember which address corresponds to which location.

I worked on modifying how the path displays for a trip's locations. The path no longer starts at your current location, but instead starts at the first destination. I also worked on changing the infoWindow content for each marker, so now each of them has the name of the destination as well as the actual address (so it's easier for users to distinguish which marker is which location).
