I worked on modifying how the path displays for a trip's locations. The path no longer starts at your current location, but instead starts at the first destination. I also worked on changing the infoWindow content for each marker, so now each of them has the name of the destination as well as the actual address (so it's easier for users to distinguish which marker is which location).
