This is a prototype of the explore page in our app. It would display lists in the nearby area and users would scroll through the list to choose one they want. If they were looking for a specific list by name, they would use to search bar. Users also have to option to narrow the number of displayed lists with the sort and filter buttons. They would be able to sort by distance or number of locations and filter by tags. Each list displayed would have its name, the locations it contains, and the tags associated with it. On desktop, each list would also show a minimized map view of the overall route.
