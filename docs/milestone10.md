# Elevator Pitch

### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
We hope to encourage people to go out and explore local places by going on trips. We want user's to explore more than one place and to think about more than just a single point A to point B.

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
TripAdvisor is the most similar to our app in terms of core functionality. Its main drawback is that there is no feature to connect multiple points of interest on the map and provide directions to each point, which is something our app provides. 

### What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Our approach will allow users to share and explore other users' lists, which makes it unique from current practices. Users can create their own lists of destinations, as well as search for other places they're interested in and discover lists for those places, all on one website. We think it will be successful because it utilizes a social aspect and people enjoy seeing what other people are interested in (which is why social media is such a huge thing).

### Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
Currently, planning fun day trips requires the use of multiple applications such as Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. Our app incorporates features from all three sources to create an all-in-one experience that makes trip planning easy and fun!
