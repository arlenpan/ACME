# Elevator Pitch

### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.


### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?


### What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Our approach will allow users to share and explore other users' lists, which makes it unique from current practices. Users can create their own lists of destinations, as well as search for other places they're interested in and discover lists for those places, all on one website. We think it will be successful because it utilizes a social aspect and people enjoy seeing what other people are interested in (which is why social media is such a huge thing).

### Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
