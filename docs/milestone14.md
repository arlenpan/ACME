# Milestone 14
## Features
### Explore
Users can discover other lists of trips near them on the "Explore" page, allowing them to easily see what other users are creating and find trips that interest them. They can also favorite these lists and easily refer back to them later in their profile pages.

### Create
Users can easily create new lists and add/remove destinations to/from their lists. They can see where each location is placed on the map and see a path connecting those destinations, as well as directions from one place to the next. There is also a feature where they can see the total trip duration and distance.

### Profile (My Lists + Favorites)
Users have their own profiles where they can see all the lists they have created and the lists they have favorited. It allows them to easily refer back to the ones they found interesting and would like to check out.

When viewing a specific list, users can choose to start from their current location (ie. if they were going to travel there that day from their apartment) or to start from the first location on the list. If it is their own created list, they can easily edit that list and add or remove destinations from that trip and save those changes if they choose to do so.

I worked on calculating and displaying the total duration and distance for each trip. I also helped implement the edit list functionality and styling (displaying the path on the map and adding new waypoints).

### Mohsin
I designed and implemented the landing page. I also worked on fixing various UI bugs with responsiveness and content styling.
