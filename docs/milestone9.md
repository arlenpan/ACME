# Milestone 9
## Screenshots

### Emily
I worked with Christy on refining the list reordering functionality and getting the map to update according to the new adjustments. I reworked the UI to make it more mobile friendly and changed the color theme. I also implemented the UI interactions so that the toggling works on the register and signin modals as well as the side menu toggling on mobile view. 

### Christy
I worked on the functionality for adding additional waypoints for the fixed list, so that users can add other locations to the list and be able to see a path including the newly added places. I also changed the map viewing options, so there are no longer terrain and satellite options.
