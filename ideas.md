# Project Ideas

1. Geographical roadrunner chase (based off looney toons)
2. On campus dining average wait time using location
3. Triton Day guide/game scavenger hunt (find landmarks/buildings)
4. Twitter scraping of campus events (puts color marks on map)
5. Available study locations on campus (map visualization)
