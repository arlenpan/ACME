# ACME

Project repo for COGS 121

See `docs` folder for milestone documentation

### Dev

- open two terminals (need to find a way to combine the two scripts) and run the following respectively

- `nodemon start`

- `npm run watch-css`

- for styling, edit scss files only. Saving them will autocompile into css files in stylesheets/css

- There shouldn't be a need to restart the server since nodemon allows live reload on appjs and routes
