# Team ACME Proposal

## Summary
ACME's app will allow users to create, customize, and share lists of activities to do, mapping out a path based on a list of places added.

## Storyboard

### Feedback
Based on the other group's feedback, we wanted to go with a feasible and novel idea that would have a longer period of use and a wider user population (as opposed to just limiting ourselves to the campus and just UCSD students, like with the Triton Day Scavenger Hunt idea). We also wanted our idea to incorporate the map more into our app than our previous ideas. We felt that our previous ideas had existing solutions that already satisfied the needs represented in the storyboards and the other groups that provided feedback also felt this way (they stated that some of our ideas, such as the nearby events idea, is probably satisfied by Facebook or Yelp already). That's why we decided to go with a new idea that was not centered around just the campus.

### Features
1) Map displays the user's current location and nearby locations (ex. coffee shops, beaches, concert halls) that are part of other users' playlists. Users can choose to use these playlists or create their own.

2) A search bar allows the user to search for playlists based on specific locations, time duration, or mood.

3) The mood feature would ask the user how they're feeling and present a couple of options (ex. adventurous, curious, relaxed). If a user chooses adventurous, they see playlists that include hiking trails, surfing spots, hangliding, etc. Choosing curious would bring up places like museums, local landmarks/monuments, guided tours. Relaxed could show small coffee shops or scenic walking trails along the beach.

4) Choosing a playlist displays its average rating and time duration, any comments it has, all the locations in that list, and the path of shortest distance between each location.

5) After completing a playlist, users can rate it, comment on it, and leave feedback on how long it took them to complete it.

### Project Work
We plan on splitting the team of four in half to focus each pair in the backend or frontend. Each pair will divide the work evenly depending on what implementation is needed. The backend and frontend group will communicate together to make sure that both sides of the app are working smoothly. Both sides will assist each other where needed but be mainly focused on their side of the app.
