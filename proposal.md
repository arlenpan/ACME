# Team ACME Proposal

## Summary
ACME's app will allow users to create, customize, and share lists of activities to do, mapping out a path based on a list of places added.

## Storyboard


### Feedback
Based on the other group's feedback, we wanted to go with a feasible and novel idea that would have a longer period of use and a wider user population. We also wanted our idea to incorporate the map more into our app than our previous ideas. We felt that our previous ideas had existing solutions that already satisfied the needs represented in the storyboards. That's why we decided to go with a new idea that was not centered around just the campus.

### Features

### Project Work
We plan on splitting the team of four in half to focus each pair in the backend or frontend. Each pair will divide the work evenly depending on what implementation is needed. The backend and frontend group will communicate together to make sure that both sides of the app are working smoothly. Both sides will assist each other where needed but be mainly focused on their side of the app.
