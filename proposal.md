# Team ACME Proposal

## Summary
ACME's app will allow users to create, customize, and share lists of activities to do, mapping out a path based on a list of places added.

## Storyboard

### Feedback
Based on the other group's feedback, we wanted to go with a feasible and novel idea that would have a longer period of use and a wider user population (as opposed to just limiting ourselves to the campus and just UCSD students, like with the Triton Day Scavenger Hunt idea). We also wanted our idea to incorporate the map more into our app than our previous ideas. We felt that our previous ideas had existing solutions that already satisfied the needs represented in the storyboards and the other groups that provided feedback also felt this way (they stated that some of our ideas, such as the nearby events idea, is probably satisfied by Facebook or Yelp already). That's why we decided to go with a new idea that was not centered around just the campus.

### Features
1) Map displays user's current location and nearby places that are part of in other users' lists.

2) A search bar allows the user to look for lists that fit specific criteria (landmarks, restaurants, beaches, etc.)

3) Users can create their own lists using places they want to check out. 

4) Choosing a list displays all the places in that list and the path of shortest distance between each place.

### Project Work
We plan on splitting the team of four in half to focus each pair in the backend or frontend. Each pair will divide the work evenly depending on what implementation is needed. The backend and frontend group will communicate together to make sure that both sides of the app are working smoothly. Both sides will assist each other where needed but be mainly focused on their side of the app.
